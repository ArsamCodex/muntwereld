ArsAPI 
There are a lot of Exchanges around like
-	Binance
-	Kraken
-	CoinBase
And to many more.
Each of this exchnges has own endpoint Restfull .that we can retrieve or get data from API like price of coins , charts , marketcap enzoâ€¦
What I want to do 
Make a single page application that can handle all of this exchanges , we are not exchang but we show the user price n all info what need , and this infos are coing from native exchanges API .
I already begin and I have all plan , im going to upload it into github
In the next jump we are be able to sel crypto from banking platforms in Belgium Eurrope and everywhere , 24 to 72 Hours to confirm ,

Hier Exaple of Binance api that show Bitcoin price in usd  https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT
The design of exchanges are readble and easy to develop , our application is first Rest application , its mean other people can get info from our API ( Live price) -
Front End  is big probllem for me .
